# Cancellable-Voice-Biometrics-through-Key-Conditioned-Deep-Audio-Steganography
End-to-end cancellable voice biometric framework that embeds key-protected speaker templates into benign audio using deep audio steganography. Combines orthogonal template transformation with a FiLM-conditioned U-Net for covert embedding and secure speaker verification.
